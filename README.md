## whoami ðŸ‘‹

A self taught ever learning software developer, with PHP Laravel (4+ years) as core skillset. I am a core backend developer with good understanding to integrate with the front end parts.

I am also an enthusiast pen-tester, with penetration knowledge I reach out to the code owners and help them notice and fix thier vulnerabilities at no cost; out of goodwill. This also helps me level up my security knowledge to myself and share it with others.

## Skills & Technologies

### Laravel TDD

- I like to do any development work with a TDD (Test Driven Development) approach. I invest roughly the same amount of time taken to manually test the feature; but the advantage is the tests can run in the blink of an eye in subsquent iterations.

- Dockering many projects
